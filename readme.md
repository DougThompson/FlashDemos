# Flash Demos #

Just a couple of Flash demos that I found hidden away in a folder.  I don't currently have access to a Flash IDE, so I can't update the code, but I've included the fla's for reference.

The Flower demo rotates through text blocks while growing dynamically generated random flowers.

The Yahtzee(R) (I am sure trademarked by Milton Bradly/Hasbro) game is a simple implementation of the game.  If this, in anyway, violates Hasbro's trademark or IP, then I will gladly remove it.
